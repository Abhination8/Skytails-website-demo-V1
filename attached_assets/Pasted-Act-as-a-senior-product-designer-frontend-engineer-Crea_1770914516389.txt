Act as a senior product designer + frontend engineer.

Create a HIGH-FIDELITY website prototype for a fintech pet-savings platform called “SkyTails”.

The new UX should be INSPIRED by the storytelling and modular layout style of Basepaws.com, but adapted for a PET FINANCIAL PLATFORM instead of a DNA testing product.

This is NOT a clone.
It is a trust-first redesign using similar UX principles.

--------------------------------------------------
GOAL
--------------------------------------------------
Current SkyTails website has high drop-off because it feels too financial too early.
Users lose trust before seeing value.

The new design must:
- Feel emotional and pet-first
- Explain benefits visually
- Introduce savings plans like product cards
- Delay signup pressure

--------------------------------------------------
TECH STACK
--------------------------------------------------

TailwindCSS

Single page prototype
No backend required
