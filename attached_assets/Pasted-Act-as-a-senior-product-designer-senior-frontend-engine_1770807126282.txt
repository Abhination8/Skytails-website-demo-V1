Act as a senior product designer + senior frontend engineer.

Build a HIGH-FIDELITY WEBSITE PROTOTYPE for a fintech-style pet savings platform called "SkyTails".

Goal:
The existing UX has high drop-off because onboarding requires long forms and financial details too early.
This prototype must demonstrate a TRUST-FIRST, LOW-FRICTION onboarding experience that improves conversion.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
Users currently:
1. Sign up
2. Enter pet details
3. Enter financial/KYC details
4. Then see dashboard

This prototype must redesign the journey using modern UX psychology.

--------------------------------------------------
PRODUCT POSITIONING
--------------------------------------------------
SkyTails is NOT insurance.
It is a savings + investment platform for pet care.

Tone:
- Trustworthy fintech
- Emotional pet-parent focus
- Clean, modern, minimal

Design inspiration:
Stripe onboarding
Notion onboarding
Wealthfront onboarding
Airbnb trust UI

--------------------------------------------------
TECH STACK
--------------------------------------------------
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion animations
- Single-page prototype
- No backend required (mock data)

--------------------------------------------------
NEW UX FLOW TO IMPLEMENT
--------------------------------------------------

STEP 0 – LANDING HERO (Trust First)
- Clear headline:
  "Build your pet’s financial future — without insurance complexity."
- Show 3 trust badges:
  Secure Accounts
  Automated Investing
  Social Mission

Primary CTA:
"Start in 30 seconds"

Secondary CTA:
"See Sample Dashboard"

--------------------------------------------------

STEP 1 – PET FIRST (EMOTIONAL ENTRY)
Instead of signup forms first, ask:
- Pet name
- Pet type (Dog, Cat, Other)
- Age slider
- Upload pet avatar (mock)

Show live preview card updating as user types.

Microcopy:
"Let’s start with who this is really about ❤️"

--------------------------------------------------

STEP 2 – PLAN SELECTION (SIMPLIFIED)
Display 3 cards:
Classic
Core
Premium

Use toggle:
Monthly savings estimate slider

When user selects plan:
Animate a mini “Future Care Fund” growth chart.

--------------------------------------------------

STEP 3 – DASHBOARD PREVIEW (EARLY REWARD)
Before financial info:
Show a simulated dashboard with:
- Pet avatar
- Savings progress
- Upcoming care suggestions
- AI investment summary

Label:
"Your future dashboard preview"

This builds trust BEFORE asking for money details.

--------------------------------------------------

STEP 4 – LIGHTWEIGHT ACCOUNT CREATION
Only ask:
- Email
- Password
- Country

Progress indicator:
Step 4 of 5

--------------------------------------------------

STEP 5 – FINANCIAL DETAILS (PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE)
Collapse into expandable sections:
[ ] Identity verification
[ ] Payment setup
[ ] Investment preferences

Each opens as an accordion instead of long form.
